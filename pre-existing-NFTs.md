# How to add ARC69 JSON to your existing ASAs

# Using NFT Explorer

## 1) Go to nftexplorer.app

Go to https://www.nftexplorer.app/ and navigate to the desired asset.
Alternatively, you can type the URL directly, such as https://www.nftexplorer.app/asset/284074520 , where the last part is the ASA ID.

## 2) Add/Edit ARC69

Once you are looking at the asset view, you can either "add" ARC69 or you can "edit" ARC69 (if already present).

NOTE: please enable popup windows from nftexplorer.app website or this process will fail.
